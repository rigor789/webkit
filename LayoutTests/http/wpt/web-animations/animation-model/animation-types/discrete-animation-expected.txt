FAIL Test animating discrete values anim.effect.getComputedTiming is not a function. (In 'anim.effect.getComputedTiming()', 'anim.effect.getComputedTiming' is undefined)
FAIL Test discrete animation is used when interpolation fails anim.effect.getComputedTiming is not a function. (In 'anim.effect.getComputedTiming()', 'anim.effect.getComputedTiming' is undefined)
FAIL Test discrete animation is used only for pairs of values that cannot be interpolated assert_equals: First non-interpolable pair uses discrete interpolation expected "200px" but got "0px"
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the effect easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at 96% of the iteration time expected "italic" but got "normal"
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the keyframe easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at 96% of the iteration time expected "italic" but got "normal"
