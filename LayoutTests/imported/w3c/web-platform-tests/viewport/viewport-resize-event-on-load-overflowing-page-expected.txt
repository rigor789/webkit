Viewport: Resize Event On Load Overflowing Page

Test Description: This test ensures that we fire a resize event against window.visualViewport if the page has overflow (since this creates a scrollbar and thus changes the viewport size).


FAIL Resize event fired exactly once against window.visualViewport if scrollbars affect layout. assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
