PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object 
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS Performance interface: operation now() 
FAIL Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "timeOrigin" expected true got false
FAIL Performance interface: operation toJSON() assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "toJSON" missing
PASS Performance must be primary interface of [object Performance] 
PASS Stringification of [object Performance]
